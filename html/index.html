        <p>A <em style="background-color:#1a89171a ;">wonderful</em> serenity has taken possession of my entire soul,
            like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone,<br>
            and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so
            happy, my dear friend,<br>
            so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.</p>

        <p>
            I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a
            greater artist than now. <br>
            When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and ,<em style="background-color:#1a89171a ;">the
                meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees</em> <br>
            and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I
            neglect my talents.
